Learning based alpha matting using support vector machine
==========================================================
# effective-SVR-Matting
##Local SVR-based matting
    Due to my research needs, the algorithm is only applicable to gray scale image.
    For RGB images, just change a small part.
    Use Matlab and Lib-SVM 3.21
    As a junior researcher, I have a lot of problems.Request for comment.
    `Thank you.`
